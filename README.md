# A demo mobile web app for Orienteering in Israel

* It's fetching data from nivut.org.il (which you can't see it on mobile browsers)

* It use responsive (h5b responsive template with twitter bootstrap) so the UI should be fine on most mobile devices.

* The alpha verison conteins:
** A list of the future events and a way to get the details per event.
** The weather in Israel: quality of air, temp, wind etc'.

Feel free to fork it and make it better.
